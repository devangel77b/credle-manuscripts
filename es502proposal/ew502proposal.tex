\section{Problem statement}
Given a small quadrotor drone with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a single camera, this research intends to begin the process of developing autonomous drone flight through a drone racing course. Given both a preloaded three dimensional path,  we will find and test the feasibility of a guidance system that collaborates computer vision with the preloaded path. This system will be tested by placing a small quadrotor in multiple scenarios in relation to a race gate(s), with varying angles of approach and gate sizes, and directing the guidance system to fly the drone through the race gate(s). Success of this system is having the drone autonomously fly through multiple race gates(?) without contact in every scenario given at the drones maximum horizontal speed. The final output of this project will a guidance system that could be implemented on any racing drone with a camera and IMU and fly through multiple race gates.
