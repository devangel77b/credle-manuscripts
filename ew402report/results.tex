\section{Results}

\subsection{Phase 1: Tello drone first flight test}
Drone flight was successfully controlled by the computer and could be maintain for approximately \SI{4}{\minute} on a single battery. All pre-programmed maneuvers were tested and performed as described. \Fref{fig:4} depicts the right flip maneuver in action.

\subsection{Phase 2: Tello video stream test}
The Tello drone built-in camera was successfully connected to the Linux terminal. \Fref{fig:5} depicts the active connection between the two systems.

\subsection{Phase 3: Gate recognition}
The Python program successfully recognized a drone race gate through color segmentation and edge recognition. The program both segmented out incorrect gate colors, objects too small to be the gate, and objects with too many or too few edges to be the gate. \Fref{fig:6} depicts both the segmented image and the original image with identified edges overlaid.

\subsection{Phase 4: Combining video steeaming and gate detection}
Combination of the Tello video streaming and image processing to recognize the gate using color thresholding was successful. \Fref{fig:7} depicts the improvised setup using a yellow piece of paper, necessary due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the program successfully detecting it.

\subsection{Phase 5: Final system integration}
Fully autonomous gate detection and navigation was successful. \Fref{fig:8} shows successive screenshots of the approach to a gate, and turning to a new gate position/
